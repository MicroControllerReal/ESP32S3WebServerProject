# The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project
The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project was designed to provide a flexible base for building various web-enabled micro-controller projects on. Using the powerful ESP32 S3, it offers 240MHz and 320KB RAM. Depending on the ESP32 S3 module used, 4-32MB of Flash is available. The ESP32 S3 offers built-in WiFi and Bluetooth support. The asynchronous library used allows up to 8 WiFi clients to be connected simultaneously. It supports HTML and WebSockets.

The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project is divided into hardware and software sections which can each be used independently or combined to provide the synergy to get a project up and running quickly. The project provides the necessary infrastructure for a wide range of simple to complex IOT projects. Using The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project allows you to concentrate on the individual aspects of your project without having to worry about the web server infrastructure. The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project hardware can be used for rapid prototyping as well as in finished projects without the need of building the hardware twice.

## Documentation
The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project is well documented, complete with examples of how you can easily add **YOUR** own features into **YOUR** own webserver or IOT project.

## Quickstart
The Quickstart section of the documentation enables you to get **YOUR** own project up and running quickly.

## Software
The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project software supports:
* Over the Air (OTA) flashing
* SD and/or LittleFS (file storage in flash memory)
* Connectivity as an access point and WiFi
* Client-side webpage Caching
* A local timezone including daylight savings time where appropriate
* Time synching over the Internet
* Admin Webpage for configuring
* File Manager Webpage
* Status Webpage
* Serial Monitor Webpage
* WebSockets
* Sending and/or Receiving Telegram messages

## Hardware
While not absolutely necessary to use the software, The ESP32 S3 Web Server Project hardware makes it easier by providing breakouts and connectors for many things. The board has been designed to use an ESP32S3 Dev Module and can be used as a standalone or to attach to the back of a 3.5 inch TFT Display, with or without a touchscreen. The board provides connectors for:
* 5V in/out
* 3.3V in/out
* SD/SDHC card (or connect to one already on the TFT display)
* SD/SDXC MMC Card
* Standard 6 pin SPI port
* I2C
* TX/RX Port
* USB Port
* Reset button
* Boot button

The *__Gerber Files__* have been included, making it easy to order your own PCBs.
